# Polymer_mc
 Monte Carlo code for modeling polymerization on a surface
 Uses Rosenbluth method to model monomer addition to a polymer brush

 New stuff -planar surface, fully flexible chains (tesselate space with Thomson-configurations of points on sphere), periodic boundary conditions in xy dimensions.
